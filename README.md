# Cathay Pacific Hackathon 2021

Developing an idea under the theme "Post-Covid Travel"

## Summary
An extension to the Cathay app that shows passengers the additional arrival requirements (due to Covid-19) for their final destination, as well as the option to have these automatically completed for them, e.g. health declaration form.

For passengers to provide evidence that they are fit for travel, they currently need to undertake a time-consuming and complicated process to fill out different forms again and again each time they travel internationally.

Our team are proud to present an extension to the Cathay app to help passengers complete documents with just a few clicks. Taking the Health Declaration Form for entry into Hong Kong as an example, passengers will only be asked to provide details regarding travel history and contact address in the city, after which the app will do the rest of the work based on their booking information.

Behind the scenes, information about each country’s arrival requirements will be kept up to date at all times, with web scraping being made use of to determine what input fields need to be filled out. A server-side automated script is used to fulfil the requirements of whatever the passenger’s arrival destination may be. For future versions, to further streamline the process, we will employ computer vision and OCR, implementing machine learning and regression framework analysis to identify input fields with maximal accuracy.

Whenever a solution includes a large amount of data, privacy will be an issue that worth looking into. Rest assured all the information we use will be end-to-end encrypted and no information retained, with our system merely piping data, minimising risk and uncertainty. 

With all this mind, we look forward to giving our passengers a sense of control over their trips, bringing them a fast and stress-free check-in experience.
